# Mutual Monitoring in the Cloud

## Problem Statement

Cloud service providers must cater to customers in regulated sectors with high barriers to entry. One barrier is evaluation of the provider's cybersecurity posture, mostly with centralized bureaucracies. Although preemptively limiting cybersecurity risk, such mandatory evaluation often means significant delay and investment before regulated customers can use new or changing building blocks they urgently need for their digital services. Are these bureaucracies an optimal solution or a last resort that failed to keep pace with cloud technology? If the latter, is there a better way?
