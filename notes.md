# Mutual Monitoring in the Cloud

## Problem Statement

Cloud service providers must cater to customers in regulated sectors with high barriers to entry. One barrier is evaluation of the provider's cybersecurity posture, mostly with centralized bureaucracies. Although preemptively limiting cybersecurity risk, such mandatory evaluation often means significant delay and investment before regulated customers can use new or changing building blocks they urgently need for their digital services. Are these bureaucracies an optimal solution or a last resort that failed to keep pace with cloud technology? If the latter, is there a better way?

  - "Fully automate FedRAMP processes. Eliminate written, qualitative assessments and document review in favor of automated security controls that can be verified through the continual assessment of network security telemetry. Rather than requiring cloud service providers (CSPs) to provide proof that they have met control requirements that cannot be automated and have those artifacts reviewed, CSPs should be allowed to 'attest' that they have met requirements for areas such as personnel training and documentation." (p. 2)
  - "The slow pace of government cloud adoption increases both costs and risks for federal operations and hinders the provision of better services to citizens. Cloud technologies offer advantages in modernization, efficiency, cybersecurity, and resilience. An agency can access and use cloud computing resources without having to buy, maintain, or modernize hardwareâ€”actions that are problematic given cumbersome federal budgeting and certification processes." (p. 3)
  - "Despite the potential gains, law, regulation, policy, and agency culture all remain obstacles to reaping the benefits of federal cloud adoption." (p. 3)
  - "To place FedRAMP on more solid legal footing, in 2022 Congress passed the FedRAMP Authorization Act. The act strongly encouraged automation and continuous monitoring to speed up the accreditation process." (p. 5)
